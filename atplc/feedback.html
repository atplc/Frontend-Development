                            ATPLC is a practical learning club. It provides regular classes for practical learning in different fields like web development, android development, object-oriented programming,c language data structure, etc. I joined ATPLC a few months ago. Now, I can create a website as well as able to good coding. And the credit for all these goes to ATPLC. I got more benefit from this club. As an engineer, practical experience is most important. Thank you Atul sir for providing us learning platform like ATPLC

                           ATPLC is a very good platform for beginners. You can learn Python, C, C++, and other languages . The topics are explained in more detail here. All the subjects started from the basic level so it helps the student to understand in a better way. You can ask all your questions or queries and you will get a proper solution to every doubt. Along with the regular classes, assignments are also available, so that the studies go on continuously. The classes are so interactive that you can ask your questions directly during that time. I am very thankful to ATPLC to give me such a good knowledge of python and C language. ATPLC makes my concept very clear and understandable.I am sure that the knowledge imparted by ATPLC will be very useful for you as well.�So, as a student I strongly recommend you to join the ATPLC club and acquire a good quality of knowledge.
